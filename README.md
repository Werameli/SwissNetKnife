# SwissNetKnife
## Ultimate lightweight scriptholder for all your scripts
## The main target of this project is to create minimal script on Python that replicates unix-like shell, that can store all your scripts in plugins. You can expand this shell by various AIO plugins.
## ScriptHolder has its own system for writing plugins with very good documentation (Visit repo's wiki to read the docs)
