# SwissNetKnife
## Ultimate lightweight scriptholder for all your scripts
## The main target of this project is to create minimal script on Python that replicates unix-like shell, that can store all your scripts in plugins. You can expand this shell by various network related plugins (and maybe in future not only network related)
